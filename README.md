 ## Documentation
 
 ### Primitive types
 Is data that is not an object and has no methods.
   - `Number` : JavaScript has only one type of numbers. Numbers can be written with, or without decimals
   - `Boolean` : Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true, and false
   - `String` : JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. 
   - `Array` : Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-key-ed properties and the 'length' property.
   - `Type conversion` : Number() converts to a Number, String() converts to a String, Boolean() converts to a Boolean, parseInt()	Parses a string and returns an integer.
 
 ##  Operators
   - Comparison and equality operators
     - Comparison operators output true or false by comparing values.
     ```
     >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==
     ```
   - Arithmetic operators
     - Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value.
     ```
     +, -, * and /
     ```
   - Logical operators
     - Logical operators combine multiple Booleans or Values and output a single boolean.
     ```
     &&, ||, and !
     ```

 ### [Scopes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)
 
   The current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible," or can be referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
   - **`var`, `let`, `const` â€“ variable types**
     - `var`: Globally scoped or function/locally scoped, can be re-declared and updated
     - `let`: Preferred for variable declaration now, block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared.
     - `const`: Maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations. cannot be updated or re-declared
   - [**Callback pattern & pass function as parameter:**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)
 
     A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
     ```javascript
     function greeting(name) {
         alert('Hello ' + name);
     }
 
     function processUserInput(callback) {
         var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
         callback(name);
     }
 
     processUserInput(greeting);
     ```
   - [**Call by value vs. call by reference**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6605640/javascript-by-reference-vs-by-value)
   
     Javascript always passes by value. However, if you pass an object to a function, the "value" is really a reference to that object, so the function can modify that object's properties but not cause the variable outside the function to point to some other object.
 
 ## Objects
  - `new` operator:
    - The new operator creates an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function. The new keyword does the following 4 things: 
         1. It creates a brand new object out of thin air.
         2. It links this object to another object.
         3. The newly created object from Step 1 gets passed as the this context.
         4. If the function doesn't return it's own object, this is returned.
         
         ```
         function Car(make, model, year) {
                       this.make = make;
                       this.model = model;
                       this.year = year;
         }
                     
         var car1 = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);
            
         console.log(car1.make);
         // expected output: "Eagle"
         ```

## Functions as objects
The value of a key in an object can be a function.<br><br>Example:
    
            let dog = {
                bark: function() {
                    alert("Wuff");
                }
            }
            let bark = dog.bark();
            
## 'new' operator 
An object can be created with a constructor-method.<br><br>Example:
    
            class dog {
                    constructor (breed, age, name, castrated) {
                        this.breed = breed;
                        this.age = age;
                        this.name = name;
                        this.castrated = castrated;
                    }
            }
            let newDog = new dog('Rodweiler', 3, 'Fluffy', true);
            
## call() 
A function (as a value) can be called with the object's name and the key.<br><br>Example:
    
            let dog = {
                name: 'Fluffy',
                greeting: 'Wuff',
                bark: function() {
                    return this.greeting;
                }
            }
            let bark = dog.bark();
            
## apply() 
A function (as a value) can be applied to other external class objects.<br><br>Example:
    
            let address = {
                bark: function() {
                    return this.greeting;
                }
            }
            let dog = {
                name: 'Fluffy',
                greeting: 'Wuff'
            }
            
            address.bark().apply(dog);
 
 ## Control Structures
 ### If - Else If - Else
 #### General Structure
 ```js
 if (condition1) {
      //when condition1 is true this will be executed
    } else if (condition2) {
      //if condition1 is false and condition2 is true this will be executed is true
    } else {
      //this will be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false
    }
 ```
 
 #### Example
    
 ```js
    let name = 'peter';
    if (name === 'max') {
         console.log('If was true')
       } else if (name === 'peter') {
         console.log('Else if was true')
       } else {
         console.log('Else was true')
       }
 ```
 
 ###### Console
    
 ```bash
   Else if was true
 ```
 
 ### Switch
 #### General Structure
 ```js
 switch (ValueToSwitch) {
      case firstValueToCompare:
        //This will run if ValueToSwitch == firstValueToCompare
        break;
      case secondValueToCompare:
       //This will run if ValueToSwitch == secondValueToCompare
        break;
 }
 ```
 
 #### Example
    
 ```js
 	let day = ""
    switch ("Peter Parker") {
      case 0:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
      case 1:
         day = "Tuesday";
        break;
      case 2:
        day = "Wednesday";
        break;
      case 3:
        day = "Thursday";
        break;
      case 4:
        day = "Friday";
        break;
      case 5:
        day = "Saturday";
        break;
      case 6:
       	day = "Sunday";
       	break;
      default:
      	day = "This is not a week day"
    }
    console.log(day)
 ```
 
 ###### Console
    
 ```bash
   This is not a week day
 ```
 
 ### For Loop
 #### General Structure
 ```js
 let i;
 for (i = 0; i < Array.length; i++) {
   //This will run while i is smaller then the Array
   //With each iteration i will increase by one
 }
 ```
 
 #### Example
    
 ```js
 let text = ""
 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   text += "The number is " + i + "\n";
 }
 console.log(text)
 ```
 
 ###### Console
    
 ```bash
   The number is 0
   The number is 1
   The number is 2
   The number is 3
   The number is 4
 ```
 
 ### While and Do While
 #### General Structure
 
 ```js
 while (condition) {
   //the code while run while condition is true
    //The check runs before the first iteration
 }
 ```
 
 ```js
 do {
   //the code while run while condition is true
   //The check runs after the first iteration
 }
 while (condition);
 ```
 
 #### Example
    
 ```js
 let i = 0;
 let text = "";
 while (i < 10) {
   text += "The number is " + i + "\n";
   i++;
 }
 console.log(text)
 ```
 
 ###### Console
    
 ```bash
 	The number is 0
 	The number is 1
 	The number is 2
 	The number is 3
 	The number is 4
 	The number is 5
 	The number is 6
 	The number is 7
 	The number is 8
 	The number is 9
 ```
 
 ## Functions
 
 ### Function hoisting
 
 Functions hoisting is best explained by looking at this example:
 
 > First we call `multiply()`
 
 ```javascript
 multiply(2, 4)
 ```
 
 > And later in the same file, we declare `multiply()`
 
 ```javascript
 function multiply(a, b) {
     return a * b;
 }
 ```
 
 In the example, we see that the function `multiply` is called, before it was declarated. And we wouldn't even get any errors with this approach. This is, because the JavaScript interpreter "looks ahead" and moves function declarations to the top of the file. **BUT** this is only the case for function declarations, like the one above. **NOT** for function expression, like the following:
 
 > In a new file, let's call `multiply()`
 
 ```javascript
 multiply(2, 4);
 ```
 > `Output: 8`<br/><br/>
 > And then call a new function `divide()`
 
 ```javascript
 divide(2, 4); 
 ```
 
 > `Output: TypeError: undefined is not a function` <br/><br/>
 > And next we're gonna declare both of the functions.
 
 ```javascript
 function multiply(a, b) { /* Nerdy math crap */ }
 var divide = function (a, b) { /* More nerdy math crap */ }
 ```
 
 > We see, multiply is function declarationg and divide is a function expression, as it's an anonymous function assigned to a variable.
 
 __TL;DR__: Traditional function declaration can be called before the function declaration. This __only__ works with function declarations, not expressions like assigning an anonymous function to a variable.

 ### Anonymous self-invoking functions
 
 Sometimes we need to initialize event-listeners, or generally perform any actions that are only required once, after the page loaded. For this we can use anonymous self-invoking functions. As the name states, the function is anonymous and executed right after it's declaration.<br/>
 Let's jump into an example:
 
 ```javascript
 (function(w, d, $) {
     // Some programmatic fuckery 
 })(window, document, jQuery);
 ```
 
 > The function above will be executed with `window`, `document`, and `jQuery` as it's parameters. Inside the function, we can access the paramers as `w`, `d` and `$`.

 ## Functions
 
 ### Function Declaration
 
 ##### Syntax:
 ````javascript
 function sum(a, b) {
   return a + b;
 }
 ````
 
 A Function Declaration is usable in the whole script.
 When JavaScript prepares to run the script or a code block, it first looks for Function Declarations in it and creates the functions.
 
 Meaning, a function declared as a Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.
 
 
 For example:
 ```javascript
 sayHi("John");
 
 function sayHi(name) {
   alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
 }
 ```
 When a Function Declaration is made within a code block, it is visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.
 
 ### Function Expression
 
 ##### Syntax:
 
 ```javascript
 let sum = function(a, b) {
   return a + b;
 };
 ```
 
 A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable from then on, but we can assign a function to a variable that is declared outside of a block.
  
 For example:
 ````javascript
 let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);
 
 let welcome;
 
 if (age < 18) {
 
   welcome = function() {
     alert("Hello!");
   };
 
 } else {
 
   welcome = function() {
     alert("Greetings!");
   };
 
 }
 
 welcome();
 ````
